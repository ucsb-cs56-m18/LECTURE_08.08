# Notes from Class

We showed a "bad" HS AP Java style program (your HS AP class was probably much better; sorry for the negative sterotyping.)

(Not sorry.)

What is bad about this program?

* No Encapsulation

# What is encapsulation

* Hides the how from the programmer (user of the class)
* Benefit: makes what you are trying to do simpler because you don't have to worry about some of the hows.
* Benefit: it makes the code easier to change:
   * Easier to find the place you need to make the change
   * Easier to know what change to make
   * Easier to make the change without breaking other things
   * Easier to write tests to know if the change is correct
   * Easier to isolate the effect of that change on other parts of the code..
   
As we will see, all of these benefits of "enscapsulation" are benefits of OOP in general, 
and more specifically, they are the main motivation for the things we call "design patterns".
