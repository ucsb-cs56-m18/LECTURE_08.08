# Notes from Class

We showed a "bad" HS AP Java style program (your HS AP class was probably much better; sorry for the negative sterotyping.)

(Not sorry.)

* No Encapsulation

# What is encapsulation

* Hides the how from the programmer (user of the class)
* Benefit: makes what you are trying to do simpler because you don't have to worry about some of the hows.
